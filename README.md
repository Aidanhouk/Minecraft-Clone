# Minecraft-Clone

The game without source code:

I used Hopson's version of Minecraft as a base. It can be found here:
https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge

It had the following features implemented:
- Biomes generation
- Collision detection
- Block breaking/placing
- Postprocessing
- Day and night cycle

Most of them had flaws or looked poor. I changed and fixed a lot of original code. After that the game felt much better.
I completely refactored blocks and biomes generation, added lots of blocks and changed textures to the original textures from Minecraft.

The features I implemented:
- Health and damage system
- Swimming and oxygen system
- HUD: inventory, toolbar, health and oxygen bars
- Snowfall and rain
- Ice sliding, leaves are not hollow anymore, acceptable block breaking/placing
- And much more
